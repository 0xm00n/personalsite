# personalsite
source code for my personal site (work in progress)

<br>

```
the point of this website is to stray away from JavaScript frameworks. 
it is complete overkill and has no purpose in a portfolio/personal website.
even going further, i have embarked on a quest to make the most creative, 
aesthethically pleasing website i can make only using pure HTML/CSS.

however, this might change later when i add blog features to the site.
but the overall goal is to not fall into the overengineering problem
of the masses which plagues the entire web.
